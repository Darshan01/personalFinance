# Personal Finance Tracker

Many finance managing apps are paid, and the free ones do not give the user the flexibility one would want with a personal finance tracker.
This project takes csv files from various popular banks and categorizes them. You will be able to view a spending, income, and cash flow summary.

# Future Plans

Add a user interface

Use artificial intelligence to categorize transactions

Allow user to manually edit the category of specific transactions.
